[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 8 0 52 65535 0 0]Before, if something was broken, I wouldn't really think about it much.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 8 0 52 65535 0 0]But lately, I've started feeling like I should fix them up so they can keep being used.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1]That's wonderful.[e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1]We'll take good care of it.[e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1]I should take after you.[e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 8 3 52 65535 0 0]Everything falls apart eventually... That's why we have to take care of it all.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 8 1 52 65535 0 0][uf 4 23 0 1 1 25 25]And if we take care of things well enough in the first place, they won't need as much fixing later.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 8 3 52 65535 0 0]I mean, I could still read the pages before, so I kind of already knew that...[n][uf 1 1][e]
