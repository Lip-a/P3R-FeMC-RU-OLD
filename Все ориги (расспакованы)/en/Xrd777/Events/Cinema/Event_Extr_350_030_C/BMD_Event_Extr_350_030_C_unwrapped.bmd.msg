[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0]Now then, let's move on to the method of using the full Arcana to tell fortunes.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0]The basic procedure is the same... You'll just be using more cards.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 3 1 3 0 65535 14805 0 0]Even with the full deck of 78, you must first shuffle, then cut, spread, and read.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0]The type of spread you use affects the procedure more than the number of cards in use.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0]Now, for a change of subject... I'll explain the various types of spreads.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 3 1 3 0 65535 14803 0 0]First, remember that the spread is chosen according to the nature of the question.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0]Do you want an answer to a single question? Or maybe an overview of the general future?[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0]Use the spread that best fits the request you have in mind.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0]Why not use a three-card spread, where you simply lay out three cards?[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0]Adding a card produces the four-card spread, identifying the past, present, nature of the problem, and future.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 3 1 3 0 65535 14805 0 0]If you use the seven-card hexagram spread, with a single card placed in the center of a hexagon...[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0]You can read both the nature of the problem and a countermeasure against it.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[msg MSG_005_5_0 [Mr. Edogawa]]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0]There is also a spread called Question and Answer, involving two choices.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 3 1 3 0 65535 14816 0 0]This reading is done by setting two countermeasures against the question.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0]Finally, the most well-known spread is the classic Celtic Cross.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0]It's suited to telling fortunes with only the Major Arcana, and is used often by both beginners and experts.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0]Then, place a pillar of four cards, known as the Spear of Destiny, next to it to the right.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0]The cross of six cards represents the overall situation, with the four to the right making it concrete.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 3 1 3 0 65535 14804 0 0]Again, this forms the 10-card spread known as the Celtic Cross.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0]There are other spreads, like the Horseshoe, Witch's Diamond, or the Seven Candles of Life...[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0]And also the normal, triangle, and cross spreads.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0]Spread them in a circle consisting of 12 cards, then place one more in the center.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0]The card in the center represents your overall fortune.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0]This is the significator.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0]For a high schooler, the Page card would be best. For an adult, the Knight, King, or Queen would do it.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0]More experienced readers may use one of the Major Arcana, but the court cards are suitable most of the time.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0]An even more advanced application would be to use it in conjunction with dowsing.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0]It's a spread where you distribute the cards according to the ten trees of life, or the Sefirot.[n][uf 1 1][e]
