[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]Observe a real-world object carefully, then re-create it in your mind, down to the last, tiny detail.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]That's the Western standard for meditation, but I'd like to talk about the Eastern style as well.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]Meditation was originally refined in the East...[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]And modern magicians adapted Eastern meditation for their own original style.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]You find the right posture, take a deep breath in and out, and calm your mind.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]That's the basic practice of the Eastern style.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]It doesn't take much to practice meditation, either.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]All you need is some free time and a relatively calm environment.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]It doesn't take long, but you should give yourself at least fifteen minutes for a proper session.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]Now for the specifics... First, your posture. Just take a position that you find comfortable.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]Sitting cross-legged is good enough for most, but you can try the full-lotus position, too—it's sometimes called "kekkafuza."[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]You can even meditate while sitting in a chair. Any position works as long as it's comfortable.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]Once your breathing is relaxed, close or cover your eyes and let the rest of your body relax too.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]Now that you've prepared yourself physically, you'll focus next on your mind and soul.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]Imagine a symbol—some simple image. Perhaps a large tree, or the moon.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]It's human nature to want what one lacks. There's no escaping it.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]The roots of alchemy originate in Hellenistic Egypt, with the city of Alexandria at its center.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]The earliest English translations of these texts brought the practice to medieval Europe, where alchemists gained both power and infamy.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]It was thought that mercury could be used to form the philosopher's stone, which would in turn allow alchemists to generate gold.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]It's when a magician conjures a pre-existing spiritual presence. At times, they are also able to control the presence for their own goals.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]How about we discuss some breathing techniques?[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]I know, some people would say breathing's anything but magic, but the two are actually closely linked.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]That's because breathing affects more than your body—it influences the mind as well.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]The ancient Greek word for breath is "pneuma." It was a very important concept in the medical science of the day.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]Later, Gnostic Christians used "pneuma" to refer to the human spirit—a concept separate from the soul.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]That was around the time when breathing techniques were recognized as being so crucial to successful magic.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 1 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]I could name all sorts of examples where this influence is felt today. Like yoga—breathing is an especially important factor there.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]There's also the Shinto concept of "ibuki," meaning both "breath" and "inner strength," that is often incorporated into martial arts training.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]So, you can see how breathing techniques have spread throughout the world thanks to the power of magic.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]But, back to practical matters... Let me show you something called dantian breathing.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]Some say Gautama Buddha himself practiced this method while on earth.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 1 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]It's a breathing exercise where you focus on a specific dantian, or energy center, in your body.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]So, the first step is simply focusing on the right dantian, as each person has multiple.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]For this exercise, focus on the lower one—it's about three finger-widths below the navel.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]Why does such a seemingly random spot on the body receive such high regard, to the point of being specially named?[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]It's because the dantian is where the most energy can be charged within the body.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]Once you start the exercise, you might notice that the energy you send there can't be felt elsewhere in the body...[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]This is because the dantian absorbs your spiritual energy, further strengthening the body and mind.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]Let's try doing some dantian breathing now.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]For first-timers, it's usually a good idea to place your hand in the proper spot. This helps to maintain focus.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]Once you've pinpointed your dantian, you can begin the breathing process.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]Imagine the air you pull in with your diaphragm is coalescing within the dantian...[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]Then, just as deliberately, exhale through the nose.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]The goal with each breath is to channel energy into your dantian until you can feel it begin to harden—that's the point when you should exhale.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]And simply repeat this process as desired. That's all![n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 1081 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 5 21 0 100]Oh! Except, one important note...[n][uf 1 1][e]
