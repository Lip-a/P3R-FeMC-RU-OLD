[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 413]Oh, that cat? He's not here.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 413]My mom said it was okay to take him home, and I came the next day to pick him up, but he was gone.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 413]That means he was free, right?[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 413]So I bet things will be better for him this way.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 413]It's okay... I won't look for him.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 413]I know he's doing great, somewhere out there.[n][uf 1 1][e]
