[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 5 0 5 65535 0 0][uf 3 1 1 0 0 2 0 0]Now that I think about it, I may never have seen such a straightforward love story before...[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 5 3 5 65535 0 0][uf 3 1 1 0 0 7 0 0]...Is that really the standard for "eternal love"?[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 5 3 5 65535 0 0][uf 3 1 1 0 0 8 0 0]In the final scene, how did the man so conveniently determine where the woman was?[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 5 2 5 65535 0 0][uf 3 1 1 0 0 9 0 0]And why would he wait until the last moment to announce that he's secretly a prince?[n][uf 1 1][e]
