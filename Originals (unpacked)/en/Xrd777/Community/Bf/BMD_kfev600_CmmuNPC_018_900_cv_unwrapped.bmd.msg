[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 3 1 1 0 6 2 181 0]Oh yes, I've heard the same story. They say he tried a bite of some dish.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 3 1 1 0 6 3 181 0]Then he said, "It could use some fish flakes." So they put some in, and sure enough, it was delicious.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 3 1 1 0 6 4 181 0]Now it's an item on our hidden menu. I'm a big fan of it, myself.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 3 1 1 0 6 7 182 0]Sure, his appearance and behavior are—how should I say this—eccentric...[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 3 1 1 0 6 8 182 0]But he knows everything about food, and his palate is refined. He's in a league of his own among gourmands.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 3 1 1 0 6 9 182 0]There's not a restaurateur around here who doesn't know him.[n][uf 1 1][e]
