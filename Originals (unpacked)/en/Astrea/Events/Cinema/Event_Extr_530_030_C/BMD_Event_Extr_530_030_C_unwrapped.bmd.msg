[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 3 3 52 65535 0 0]Also, why the heck would you guard and run from the opponent here? Makes zero sense.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 4 0 52 65535 0 0]I see... So you're wondering why this guy didn't just follow up with another attack instead?[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 3 4 52 65535 0 0]I mean, look! His opponent's pretty much cornered, right? Don't get why you'd just back off after that.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 4 0 52 65535 0 0]He's letting himself get hit on purposeâ€”[n]probably because he's setting up a trap.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 4 0 52 65535 0 0]What would you do here, Aigis? Would you still charge ahead, fists flying, when you know it's a trap?[n][uf 1 1][e]
